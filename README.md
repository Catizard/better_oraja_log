# Better Oraja Log

This repo holds a small script for hacking the `scoredatalog.db` from `beatoraja` and its variants.The original problem is `beatoraja` doesn't record down every logs correctly.

## How to use

> BACKUP YOUR OWN FILE BEFORE DOING ANYTHING!

This is a tui application, put it at the same directory with your `scoredatalog.db` and open it at your terminal and it would pop up a form for you selecting the `scoredatalog.db` file path which should be located at same directory. Then pressing enter, a new file called `better_scoredatalog.db` would be generated at the same directory. Replace your old `scoredatalog.db` file with it.
